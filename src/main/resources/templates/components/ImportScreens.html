         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">This software allows you to transfer data to Constantine [IN]GRID Polariscope from a source Constantine [IN]GRID or adjacent file.</p>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">This tool will allow you to either permanently overwrite existing data in Constantine [IN]GRID Polariscope or create new member entries from the imported data. Please be aware that changes made from this software cannot be reversed unless a backup is restored.</p>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">Currently, Constantine [IN]GRID Polariscope only supports importing members listed in RankStar. Other sheets in Constantine [IN]GRID are not currently supported. Please make sure to only submit RankStar.</p>
         <div class="alert alert-warning my-3" role="alert">
            <p class="m-0 fs-4">Exiting this software before the import has started will result in no changes being made to the currently saved data.</p>
         </div>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">Please read the following explanation thoroughly before proceeding</p>`,
        `<h2 class="fw-bold">Requirements</h2>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">A data transfer requires:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">A currently running installation of Constantine [IN]GRID Polariscope with at least one user account</p></li>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">Sufficient storage space on target system for incoming data</p></li>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">A source Constantine [IN]GRID file</p></li>
         </ul>`,
        `<h2 class="fw-bold">About Merging Information Onto Existing Members</h2>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">This tool will allow you to overwrite existing members with members tracked in the incoming Constantine [IN]GRID source file. In order to overwrite the existing data on Constantine [IN]GRID Polariscope, you must manually map these members with each other.</p>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">Please give extra care to this step, as it can potentially overwrite and delete evaluations and data on a member. A recovery of this information will require a backup restoration.</p>`,
        `<h2 class="fw-bold">About Merging Information Onto Existing Members</h2>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">This tool requires .CSV files to import members. Constantine [IN]GRID is typically kept in a Microsoft Excel format (.xlsx) which is currently not supported.</p>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">In order to continue the import, you must convert the RankStar sheet into its own .csv file before uploading it in this tool. Here are some general steps below:</p>
         <ol>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">Open source Constantine [IN]GRID file in Microsoft Excel</p></li>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">Navigate to save as menu</p></li>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">When choosing a save location, make sure to specify the file format as a .csv file</p></li>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">Carefully read through the warning popups and proceed to saving a copy as a .csv file</p></li>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">Save this file in a location that you can locate and readily upload to this tool.</p></li>
         </ol>`,
        `<h2 class="fw-bold">About Transferring Data (1/2)</h2>
         <p class="mb-3 fs-4">The following data will be transferred</p>
         <ul>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">Member names, sex, birthday and relationship to you</p></li>
            <li><p class="mb-3 fs-4">Personality type, description, and sexuality</p></li>
