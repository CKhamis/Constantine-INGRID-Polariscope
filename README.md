# Constantine Polariscope
Constantine Polariscope is a journaling program focused mainly on your interpersonal relationships. This can include family, friends, coworkers, and other people you have a connection to.

With this tool, you can track a person's basic information like their names, profile image, birthday, and others. However, Polariscope can track more advanced relationship features.

More specifically, Polariscope allows you to write evaluations about individuals. These evaluations include a timestamp, score, and an optional note.

## Features
### Interpersonal Network
This new feature allows users to map their interpersonal connections between others. Works closely with the groups feature to give you a better look at the social atmosphere you're in.
### Password-Based Encryption
Sensitive data entries in this program are encrypted using an object's randomized ID as well as a hash of the user's password different than the one persisted into memory. This effectively makes malicious decryption far less practical without knowing the user password.
### Privacy Screen
In order to combat screen peaking, Polariscope has a feature implemented in almost every page to prevent it. This feature covers everything you see on screen with a grey box such that nobody would be able to see what you are doing. It may look like a page is loading or broken.
### Dashboard
This feature allows you to see an overview of all your members in sorted lists. These lists can contain users that you haven't updated in a while. This also allows you to see a heatmap of how many changes you made to your members per day.
### All Members
This feature allows you to see an organized list of all the members you have entered into Constantine Polariscope. On this screen, you will be able to filter through your members and go to their records.
### Member Records
This feature allows you to view information about a specific member you add to Polariscope. You will be able to access a general overview about your relationship with the user, modify attributes related to the member, see all evaluations, add/ edit evaluations, and other settings.
### Groups
This feature allows you to combine like members into a grouping to see their collective events, statistics, and more. Members can only be placed into one group.
### Batch Evaluate
This feature allows you to add evaluations to all members in a queue. This makes it simpler and faster if you want to add evaluations to everyone at once.
### Member Compare
This feature allows you to select as many or little members as you want and display their evaluation scores in a graph to compare with each-other. Below this graph, a comprehensive timeline is displayed with all notes that have ever been written about the members you selected in chronological order.
### Add Members
This feature allows you to add new members to your account. It is a very simple feature and only requires basic information to complete.
